You've landed an audition. Congratulations! Now comes the real work—preparation that can make the difference between a callback and a "thanks, we'll be in touch."

After speaking with dozens of casting directors and working actors, one thing is clear: thorough preparation isn't just about knowing your lines. It's about showing up as a professional who understands the material, makes strong choices, and can take direction.

This comprehensive checklist will walk you through everything you need to do before you step into that audition room (or in front of that camera for self-tapes).

## The 48-Hour Countdown: What to Do When You Get the Audition

### Immediately Upon Receiving Sides

**Read the entire scene multiple times** (not just your lines)

- Understand the full context, not just your part
- Note what happens before and after your character's entrance
- Identify the emotional arc of the scene

**Research the project**

- Look up the show/film/commercial online
- Understand the tone and genre
- Watch similar work by the director or production company
- Check if there's a script or pilot available

**Clarify logistics**

- Confirm audition time and location (or self-tape deadline)
- Note if you need to prepare multiple scenes
- Check dress code or character appearance notes
- Verify if props or specific wardrobe is needed

**Study your character breakdown**

- Highlight key character traits mentioned
- Note any specific accent, physicality, or skills required
- Understand the character's relationship to others in the scene

### 24-48 Hours Before: Deep Preparation

#### Script Analysis

**Identify your character's objective**

- What does your character want in this scene?
- Why do they want it?
- What's at stake if they don't get it?

**Map the emotional beats**

- Where are the shifts in the scene?
- When does your character's tactic change?
- What's the arc from beginning to end?

**Understand relationships**

- Who are you talking to and what's your history?
- What's the power dynamic?
- How does your character feel about the other person?

**Make specific choices**

- Don't play general emotions—make detailed, personal choices
- Find moments that surprise or reveal something unexpected
- Trust your instincts, but be prepared to adjust

#### Memorization Strategy

**Memorize strategically**

- Be "off-book" enough to maintain eye contact
- But don't stress about word-perfect if it's not required
- Some casting directors prefer you hold the sides; clarify if unsure

**Understand thought patterns**

- Know the logic behind every line
- Be able to paraphrase your lines in your own words
- This helps if you blank—you can still communicate the thought

**Practice cue recognition**

- Know exactly what line you respond to
- Practice picking up cues naturally
- Don't anticipate—react in the moment

#### Physical and Technical Preparation

**Plan your wardrobe**

- Dress to suggest the character, not costume
- Wear colors that complement your skin tone on camera
- Avoid busy patterns, loud jewelry, or logos
- Ensure clothes are comfortable and allow movement

**Prepare your audition materials**

- Print sides clearly (if in-person)
- Have headshot and resume ready
- Bring a water bottle
- Have your conflict calendar available

**For self-tapes specifically:**

- Test your lighting and sound setup
- Choose a neutral background
- Frame yourself properly (chest up, generous headroom)
- Do test recordings to check quality

### The Night Before

**Run the scene multiple ways**

- Try different tactics and emotional temperatures
- Explore both subtle and bold choices
- Find what feels most authentic and interesting

**Rehearse with scene partners or AI**

- Practice with someone reading opposite you
- Get comfortable with the give-and-take
- Work on listening and reacting, not just delivering lines

**Physical self-care**

- Get a full night's sleep (memorization consolidates during sleep)
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid alcohol and heavy foods
- Do light exercise to reduce anxiety

**Mental preparation**

- Visualize a successful audition
- Remember: you've already been invited—they want you to be great
- Prepare 2-3 questions you might ask if given the opportunity
- Review but don't over-rehearse (stay fresh)

## Audition Day: The Final Checklist

### 2-3 Hours Before

**Physical warm-up**

- Vocal warm-ups (especially if you're doing accents)
- Body stretches to release tension
- Breathing exercises for nerves

**Mental focus**

- Review your character choices one final time
- Don't learn new blocking or make major changes
- Put yourself in your character's mindset

**Practical preparation**

- Eat a light meal (nothing that affects your voice or energy)
- Use the bathroom
- Silence your phone
- Leave early to account for traffic/parking

### Arriving at the Audition

**Be early, but not too early**

- Arrive 10-15 minutes before your time
- Earlier can disrupt their schedule
- Use waiting time to focus, not socialize excessively

**Professional conduct**

- Be kind to everyone (assistants, other actors, janitors)
- Keep conversation professional and positive
- Avoid negative comments about other projects or people
- Stay off your phone—stay present

**Use the space**

- If you can see the room beforehand, note the layout
- Identify where you'll stand and where the reader will be
- Visualize the space while waiting

## In the Audition Room: What Casting Directors Want

### The Slate

**Be confident and personable**

- State your name clearly
- Make eye contact with the camera
- Show a glimpse of your personality
- Keep it brief and professional

### The Performance

**Make a strong entrance**

- Bring focus and energy from the start
- You have 10 seconds to make an impression
- Start with clear choices

**Stay connected**

- Listen and react to your scene partner (or reader)
- Maintain appropriate eye contact
- Don't anticipate responses—let them land

**Show your range**

- If given direction, adjust immediately and boldly
- This is what they're really looking for—can you take notes?
- Don't defend your original choice, just try the new one

**Know when to stop**

- If they stop you, stop immediately
- Don't apologize or ask to start over unless invited
- Thank them and be ready to go again if asked

### After the Scene

**Be professional**

- Thank them sincerely
- Answer any questions thoughtfully
- Don't linger or overstay
- Exit with the same confidence you entered

**If you made a mistake:**

- Don't apologize profusely or make excuses
- If it was major, you can say "May I start again?"
- Most of the time, they won't even notice small mistakes

## Self-Tape Specific Guidelines

Self-tapes have become increasingly common. Here's what matters:

### Technical Quality

**Lighting**

- Natural light is best (face a window)
- Or use ring light/softbox facing you
- Avoid harsh overhead lighting or backlighting

**Sound**

- Quiet room with minimal echo
- Test for background noise (AC, traffic, appliances)
- Use your phone's built-in mic (usually fine)
- Speak clearly but naturally

**Framing**

- Chest up in frame
- Generous headroom (don't cut off your head)
- Centered, or slightly off-center if reader is off-screen
- Neutral background (solid wall, not cluttered)

**Camera angle**

- At eye level (not looking down or up)
- Stable (use a tripod or stable surface)
- High enough resolution (most phone cameras are fine)

### Performance on Camera

**Eye line**

- Reader should be just beside the camera lens
- Or look directly at lens if talking to camera
- Don't look at yourself in the phone screen during takes

**Energy adjustment**

- Slightly more intimate than stage acting
- Thoughts and small reactions read well on camera
- Don't project as if on stage

**Multiple takes**

- Do 2-3 takes with different choices
- Label them clearly in filenames
- Submit your best 1-2 (unless they want more)

### Submission

**File naming**

- Format: LastName_FirstName_ProjectName_Character.mp4
- Example: Smith_John_LawAndOrder_Detective.mp4

**File format**

- MP4 or MOV (confirm which they prefer)
- Under file size limit (usually 100MB or less)
- Standard resolution (1920x1080 is fine)

**Deadline**

- Submit before the deadline, not at the deadline
- Technical issues happen—give yourself buffer time
- Confirm upload was successful

## What Casting Directors Are Really Looking For

Based on conversations with casting professionals, here's what matters most:

**1. Preparation**
They can tell in 10 seconds if you've done the work. Know your lines, understand the scene, make clear choices.

**2. Professionalism**
Be on time, be pleasant, take direction well, make their job easier.

**3. Authentic choices**
Don't play what you think they want—make personal, specific, truthful choices.

**4. Ability to adjust**
Can you take a note and immediately try something different? This is crucial.

**5. The "right fit"**
Sometimes it's not about talent—it's about whether you match their vision. Don't take it personally.

**6. Confidence without arrogance**
Be assured in your choices without being rigid or defensive.

**7. Listening**
Actually hearing and reacting to what's happening in the scene, not just waiting for your next line.

## Common Audition Mistakes to Avoid

**Over-apologizing**
If you make a mistake, don't derail everything with apologies. Stay in the moment.

**Making excuses**
They don't want to hear about traffic, your dog, or that you just got the sides. They just want to see you act.

**Asking too many questions**
Have one or two smart questions maximum. Don't turn it into a workshop.

**Over-acting**
Bigger isn't better. Make strong, clear choices but stay authentic.

**Ignoring redirection**
If they give you a note, don't defend your choice or barely adjust. Make a bold shift.

**Bringing negativity**
Never bad-mouth previous projects, directors, or other actors.

**Unprofessional appearance**
First impressions matter. Look put-together and character-appropriate.

## After the Audition

**Immediate follow-up:**

- Don't email or call asking how you did
- If you forgot to mention a conflict, notify your agent/manager immediately
- Otherwise, wait for them to contact you

**For your records:**

- Note what you learned or would do differently
- Record any feedback you received
- Update your audition tracker with date and project

**Move on:**

- Don't obsess over the result
- Get back to training and other auditions
- Remember: most auditions don't lead to bookings, even for working actors

## Building Your Audition Practice Routine

Great auditions don't happen by accident. They're the result of consistent practice:

**Weekly practice:**

- Cold read new sides regularly
- Practice auditioning on camera
- Get feedback from coaches or trusted peers
- Work on weak areas (accent work, comedy timing, emotional range)

**Use technology:**

- Record yourself and review objectively
- Practice with AI scene partners for immediate rehearsal
- Study auditions from actors you admire

**Maintain skills:**

- Keep monologues fresh and ready
- Stay up on current shows and films
- Take classes or workshops regularly
- Network within the industry

## The Bottom Line

Audition preparation is where you prove your professionalism and craft. While talent matters, preparation is what separates actors who book from those who don't.

Use this checklist before every audition. Adjust it based on what works for you, but maintain the discipline of thorough preparation. Your future self—booking that dream role—will thank you.

Remember: casting directors want you to succeed. They're not sitting there hoping you fail. They want you to be the solution to their problem. Your job is to make their decision easy by showing up prepared, professional, and committed to your choices.

Now go book that job.
