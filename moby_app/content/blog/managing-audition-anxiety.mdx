You've prepared thoroughly. You know your lines. You understand your character. But as your audition time approaches, your heart races, your palms sweat, and your mind floods with catastrophic "what-ifs."

You're experiencing audition anxiety—and you're far from alone. According to research, about 40% of adults in the U.S. suffer from some degree of stage fright, with actors and performers particularly vulnerable to this specific type of social anxiety.

Here's what many actors don't realize: the goal isn't to eliminate anxiety. Research shows that actors can perform well while experiencing anxiety symptoms. The key is learning to function effectively despite nerves, transforming anxiety from a barrier into manageable energy that fuels your performance.

This comprehensive guide provides evidence-based strategies drawn from cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness practices, and performance psychology to help you manage audition anxiety and deliver your best work under pressure.

## Understanding Audition Anxiety

Before you can manage anxiety, you need to understand what's actually happening in your mind and body.

### What Is Performance Anxiety?

Performance anxiety is anxiety that shows up in specific circumstances when an individual believes others are evaluating their behavior and that a particular outcome is expected of them. It falls under the umbrella of social anxiety disorder.

**Common triggers:**

- Auditions (in-person or self-tape)
- Callbacks with producers/directors
- Cold readings with minimal prep time
- First rehearsals with new cast
- Opening nights and performances
- Industry showcases
- Meeting with agents or managers

### The Physical Experience

Performance anxiety manifests through multiple systems in your body:

**Physical symptoms:**

- Rapid heartbeat or palpitations
- Shallow, rapid breathing
- Sweating (especially hands, underarms, forehead)
- Trembling or shaking hands/voice
- Nausea or butterflies in stomach
- Dry mouth
- Muscle tension (shoulders, jaw, fists)
- Feeling hot or cold
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Need to use bathroom frequently

**Cognitive symptoms:**

- Racing thoughts
- Catastrophic thinking ("I'll completely mess up")
- Negative self-talk
- Difficulty concentrating
- Memory problems (blanking on lines)
- Obsessive worry about outcome
- Comparing yourself to others
- Fear of judgment
- Perfectionist thinking

**Behavioral symptoms:**

- Avoiding auditions altogether
- Over-preparing to the point of exhaustion
- Under-preparing due to avoidance
- Apologizing excessively
- Making excuses
- Fidgeting or pacing
- Speaking too quickly
- Breaking character or focus

### Why It Happens: The Stress Response

Your body's alarm system is designed to prepare you for challenges—it's the "fight or flight" response triggered by perceived threats.

**What's happening:**

1. Your brain perceives audition as threat
2. Stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) flood system
3. Heart rate increases, breathing quickens
4. Blood flow redirected to major muscles
5. Digestive system slows down
6. Senses heighten
7. Rational thinking decreases

**The problem:** Your ancient survival system can't distinguish between life-threatening danger and social evaluation. It responds the same way to a casting director's scrutiny as it would to a predator.

### Risk Factors That Increase Vulnerability

Certain factors make you more susceptible to audition anxiety:

**Personality traits:**

- Perfectionism
- High self-criticism
- Fear of negative evaluation
- Tendency toward worry
- Low self-confidence
- History of social anxiety

**Experience factors:**

- Past negative audition experiences
- Limited audition experience
- Recent rejection or failure
- Transitions (new city, new level of work)

**External pressures:**

- Financial stress (needing to book)
- Time pressure (last-minute auditions)
- High-stakes opportunities (dream role)
- Comparisons to other actors
- Industry competition awareness

**Underlying conditions:**

- Generalized anxiety disorder
- Social anxiety disorder
- Panic disorder
- Depression
- ADHD (difficulty with focus under pressure)

### The Anxiety Paradox

Here's what makes audition anxiety particularly insidious: anxiety about being anxious makes it worse.

**The cycle:**

1. Anticipate anxiety ("I'm going to be so nervous")
2. Anxiety about anxiety increases physiological arousal
3. Notice anxiety symptoms ("My heart's racing!")
4. Interpret as evidence you'll fail
5. Anxiety intensifies further
6. Performance suffers or you avoid situation
7. Reinforces belief that anxiety = failure

**Breaking the cycle** requires accepting anxiety as normal rather than fighting it.

## The Research-Backed Truth About Anxiety and Performance

Let's address some critical misconceptions:

### Myth vs. Reality

**MYTH:** "I need to feel calm and confident to perform well"
**REALITY:** Performers predicted they'd be unable to perform while experiencing anxiety, but when tested, they auditioned well while experiencing anxiety symptoms. The intensity of anxiety is not a good indicator of how your performance is actually perceived.

**MYTH:** "If I'm anxious, everyone can tell and will judge me"
**REALITY:** Internal anxiety feels much more extreme than it appears externally. Slight trembling or voice quiver that feels overwhelming to you often goes unnoticed by casting directors.

**MYTH:** "My anxiety will keep getting worse until I can't function"
**REALITY:** Anxiety naturally peaks and then decreases, even if you do nothing. Jitters tend to go away often in less than a minute once you start, even if it feels longer.

**MYTH:** "Successful actors don't experience stage fright"
**REALITY:** Even titans of the industry experience anxiety. Lawrence Olivier and Paul Newman admitted to being almost paralyzed by live appearances. The difference is they learned to perform despite it.

### The Acceptance Principle

Cognitive behavioral therapy has the strongest evidence base for overcoming performance anxiety. A core principle: trying to repress, deny, or fight anxiety tends to make it worse.

**Instead:**

1. Label the anxiety: "I feel anxious"
2. Accept it: "This is a normal response"
3. Allow it: "It's okay for this to be here"
4. Separate from it: "I notice anxiety, but it's not the total of my experience"
5. Act anyway: "I can still access joy and passion of my craft"

This approach—called acceptance-based therapy—shows promising results for performance anxiety, sometimes even more effective than traditional CBT for improving actual performance quality.

## Immediate Techniques: Managing Anxiety in the Moment

When anxiety hits right before or during your audition, these evidence-based techniques can help quickly.

### Tactical Breathing (Box Breathing)

Navy SEALs use this technique to perform better under extreme pressure:

**The 4-4-4-4 pattern:**

1. Inhale deeply for 4 counts
2. Hold breath for 4 counts
3. Exhale slowly for 4 counts
4. Hold empty for 4 counts
5. Repeat 4-5 times

**Why it works:**

- Activates parasympathetic nervous system (calming)
- Increases oxygen to brain
- Gives mind something to focus on
- Physically impossible to panic while doing correctly

**When to use:**

- In waiting room before audition
- Moments before entering audition space
- During breaks in self-tape recording
- After making mistake (reset quickly)

### Grounding Techniques

Grounding brings you back to present moment when anxiety spirals into future catastrophizing.

**5-4-3-2-1 Technique:**

- Name 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

**Physical grounding:**

- Feel your feet firmly on the floor
- Notice weight of body in chair
- Press palms together and notice sensation
- Hold a small object and focus on texture
- Notice temperature, pressure, contact points

**Why it works:**

- Redirects attention from internal anxiety to external environment
- Uses all senses to anchor in reality
- Interrupts anxiety spiral
- Brings you to present (where threat doesn't actually exist)

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation

**Quick version (2-3 minutes):**

1. Tense shoulders up to ears (hold 5 seconds)
2. Release and notice difference
3. Clench fists tight (hold 5 seconds)
4. Release and feel relaxation
5. Scrunch facial muscles (hold 5 seconds)
6. Release completely
7. Take three deep breaths

**Why it works:**

- Releases physical tension that feeds anxiety
- Creates contrast (helps you notice relaxation)
- Gives you sense of control
- Reduces muscle trembling

### Centering Exercise

Drawn from martial arts and performance psychology:

**Steps:**

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Bend knees slightly
3. Lower center of gravity
4. Take deep breath into belly
5. As you exhale, imagine energy settling into center
6. Feel strong, grounded, present
7. Maintain this state for 30-60 seconds

**Why it works:**

- Creates physical sense of stability
- Connects mind and body
- Reduces feeling of being "out of body"
- Provides concrete physical anchor

### Positive Reframing

Anxiety often speaks in black-and-white catastrophes. Practice choosing more balanced thoughts.

**Common anxious thought → Reframed thought:**

"Everyone will laugh at me"
→ "I've never been at a wedding where someone mocked a speaker. Most people are supportive."

"I'll definitely mess up"
→ "I've prepared well. Even if I make a small mistake, I can recover and continue."

"They'll think I'm terrible"
→ "They invited me because they think I might be right. They want me to succeed."

"This anxiety means I'm not meant to be an actor"
→ "All actors experience nerves. This just means I care about my work."

"I need to be perfect"
→ "I need to be present, prepared, and willing to take risks. Perfect doesn't exist."

**The practice:**

1. Notice catastrophic thought
2. Acknowledge it ("That's anxiety talking")
3. Question it ("Is this really true? What's the evidence?")
4. Replace with more realistic thought
5. Don't argue with yourself—just offer alternative

### Visualization and Mental Rehearsal

Mentally rehearsing success reduces anticipatory anxiety and boosts confidence.

**Effective visualization:**

1. Close eyes and take deep breaths
2. Imagine entire audition from start to finish
3. See yourself walking in, fully prepared
4. Visualize slating your name confidently
5. Picture yourself disappearing into character
6. See casting directors engaged and responsive
7. Imagine walking out feeling proud
8. Feel the satisfaction of doing your best work

**Keys to effectiveness:**

- Use all senses (what you see, hear, feel)
- Imagine it as if it's happening now (not "I will")
- Include positive emotions (satisfaction, joy)
- Repeat visualization multiple times
- Use empowering, specific language
- Focus on your process, not their response

**When to practice:**

- Several times daily leading up to audition
- Night before audition
- Morning of audition
- In waiting room (eyes open version)

## Long-Term Strategies: Building Resilience

Managing anxiety in the moment is crucial, but building lasting resilience requires consistent practice.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Approaches

CBT is the gold standard, evidence-based treatment for performance anxiety. You can work with a therapist or apply principles yourself.

**Core CBT principles:**

**1. Identify anxiety-inducing thoughts:**
Keep a thought journal noting:

- Trigger situation
- Automatic thought that arose
- Emotion and intensity (0-10)
- Evidence for and against thought
- More balanced alternative thought
- Resulting emotion intensity

**2. Challenge and reframe thoughts:**
For each anxious thought, ask:

- What's the evidence this is true?
- What's the evidence against it?
- What would I tell a friend in this situation?
- What's the worst that could actually happen?
- What's the best that could happen?
- What's the most realistic outcome?

**3. Behavioral experiments:**
Test your fears through exposure:

- Predict what will happen if you do feared behavior
- Actually do it
- Note what actually happened
- Compare prediction to reality
- Update your beliefs based on evidence

**Example:**

- Fear: "If I show vulnerability in an audition, they'll think I'm unprofessional"
- Experiment: Intentionally make a vulnerable choice in low-stakes audition
- Outcome: Casting director responds positively, comments on authentic moment
- Learning: Vulnerability can be strength, not weakness

### Exposure Hierarchy for Audition Anxiety

Systematic exposure to feared situations gradually builds confidence.

**Creating your hierarchy:**

1. List all audition-related situations causing anxiety
2. Rate each situation's anxiety level (0-100)
3. Order from least to most anxiety-provoking
4. Start with easiest situation
5. Practice until anxiety naturally decreases
6. Move to next level

**Sample hierarchy:**

1. (20) Watch video of yourself performing
2. (30) Practice self-taping in private
3. (40) Record self-tape and share with trusted friend
4. (50) Perform monologue for acting class
5. (60) Attend low-stakes audition (student film)
6. (70) Self-tape for professional project
7. (80) In-person audition for guest star role
8. (85) Callback with producers
9. (90) Chemistry read with series lead
10. (95) Final callback for series regular

**Practice guidelines:**

- Stay in each situation until anxiety peaks and decreases
- Don't leave when anxiety is highest (reinforces avoidance)
- Repeat same level multiple times before advancing
- Celebrate small victories
- Be patient with process (takes time)

### Mindfulness and Meditation Practice

Mindfulness is the practice of being aware of your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and environment in the present moment without judgment.

**Why mindfulness helps anxiety:**

- Anxiety lives in past (what went wrong) and future (what might go wrong)
- Present moment is usually actually okay
- Reduces rumination and catastrophizing
- Increases awareness without reactivity
- Builds capacity to observe anxiety without being consumed by it

**Daily mindfulness practice (10-15 minutes):**

1. Sit comfortably with straight spine
2. Focus attention on breath
3. When mind wanders (it will), notice without judgment
4. Gently return attention to breath
5. Repeat hundreds of times
6. Build this "attention muscle" over time

**Mindfulness apps:**

- Headspace (guided meditations)
- Calm (sleep and anxiety specific)
- Insight Timer (free, huge library)
- Ten Percent Happier (skeptics welcome)
- Waking Up (Sam Harris, more philosophical)

**Mindfulness in auditions:**

- Notice when mind jumps to future worry
- Gently return to present moment
- Focus on what's actually happening right now
- Engage senses (what do I see, hear, feel?)
- Stay with breath as anchor

### Yoga and Physical Practice

Yoga practice improves stress response and fear management through:

- Breath awareness and control
- Body-mind connection
- Nervous system regulation
- Building tolerance for discomfort
- Present-moment focus

**Styles helpful for anxiety:**

- Hatha (gentle, accessible)
- Yin (slow, restorative)
- Restorative (deeply relaxing)
- Yoga Nidra (guided meditation/relaxation)

**Even without formal practice:**

- Regular stretching reduces tension
- Breath-focused movement calms nerves
- Body awareness grounds you
- Physical practice processes stress

### Building Sustainable Self-Care

Underlying anxiety worsens when basic needs aren't met:

**Physical self-care:**

- Consistent sleep schedule (7-9 hours)
- Regular exercise (30+ minutes, 3-5x/week)
- Balanced nutrition (not skipping meals)
- Limited caffeine (especially before auditions)
- Limited alcohol (worsens anxiety over time)
- Adequate hydration

**Mental self-care:**

- Therapy or counseling when needed
- Meditation or mindfulness practice
- Journaling thoughts and feelings
- Creative outlets beyond acting
- Time in nature
- Social connection with supportive people

**Career self-care:**

- Clear boundaries around work
- Financial stability plan (reduces desperation)
- Multiple income streams if possible
- Realistic expectations about booking rates
- Celebration of small wins
- Identity beyond acting ("I am not my career")

## Reframing the Meaning of Auditions

How you think about auditions fundamentally affects your anxiety level.

### Shifting Your Perspective

**From:** "I need to book this job"
**To:** "This is an opportunity to practice my craft and meet industry professionals"

**From:** "They're judging whether I'm good enough"
**To:** "I'm showing them my interpretation and seeing if we're a good creative fit"

**From:** "I can't handle another rejection"
**To:** "Each audition improves my skills and expands my network. Not booking is data, not judgment of my worth"

**From:** "Everyone else is more talented"
**To:** "I have unique qualities and perspectives to offer. There's enough room for everyone's success"

**From:** "If I'm anxious, I'll definitely fail"
**To:** "I can perform well even while feeling anxious. The anxiety actually shows I care"

### Understanding the Numbers

**Reality check on booking rates:**

- Even working actors book only 1 in 20-30 auditions
- This is industry standard, not personal failure
- Most auditions don't lead to bookings for anyone
- Rejection is about fit, timing, factors beyond your control
- Your job is to do your best work, not to book every role

**What this means:**

- Failure to book ≠ failure as actor
- Most "no's" aren't about your talent
- Sometimes you're too tall, too short, too young, too old
- Sometimes they're seeing network notes or exec preferences
- Sometimes another actor has a prior relationship
- Sometimes you do great work and still don't book—that's normal

### The Growth Mindset

Fixed mindset: "I'm either good at auditions or I'm not"
Growth mindset: "Audition skills can be developed with practice"

**Applying growth mindset:**

- View anxiety as something to learn about and manage
- See each audition as practice opportunity
- Recognize improvement happens gradually
- Celebrate learning, not just outcomes
- Ask "What can I learn?" instead of "Why do I suck?"

### Normalizing Nerves

Remember: Nerves mean you care. Being nervous is evidence that what you're doing matters to you. The most successful performers still experience nerves—they've just learned to work with them rather than against them.

## When to Seek Professional Help

Self-help strategies work for mild to moderate anxiety, but sometimes professional support is necessary.

### Signs You Should See a Therapist

- Anxiety regularly prevents you from auditioning
- Panic attacks during or before auditions
- Anxiety interfering with daily life
- Substance use to manage anxiety
- Depression accompanying anxiety
- Physical symptoms impacting health
- Self-help strategies not helping after 3 months
- Anxiety worsening over time

### Types of Therapy for Performance Anxiety

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**

- Most evidence-based for anxiety disorders
- Focuses on thoughts, beliefs, behaviors
- Typically 12-20 sessions
- Includes exposure therapy component
- Helps identify and challenge anxious thoughts

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**

- Newer "third-wave" therapy
- Focuses on accepting feelings without judgment
- Commits to actions aligned with values
- Shows promising results for performance anxiety
- May be more effective than CBT for improving performance quality (not just reducing symptoms)

**Psychodynamic/Relational Therapy:**

- Examines how past relationships fuel current anxiety
- Explores self-criticism and fear of judgment
- Fosters insight and steadier sense of self
- Longer-term approach
- Good for deep-rooted anxiety patterns

**Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR):**

- Structured 8-week program
- Combines mindfulness meditation and yoga
- Decreases physiological arousal
- Increases present-moment focus
- Group format available

### Finding the Right Therapist

Look for therapists who:

- Specialize in anxiety disorders or performance-related issues
- Have experience working with actors/performers
- Use evidence-based treatments (CBT, ACT, MBSR)
- Understand the unique pressures of entertainment industry
- Create collaborative, non-judgmental environment

**Resources for finding therapists:**

- Psychology Today therapist directory
- Your health insurance provider list
- Entertainment Assist (mental health support for entertainment industry)
- Local university counseling centers (often low-cost)
- Online therapy platforms (BetterHelp, Talkspace)

### When Medication Might Help

Some people benefit from medication for severe anxiety:

**Common options:**

- SSRIs (long-term, daily medication)
- Beta-blockers (as-needed, for physical symptoms)
- Buspirone (daily anti-anxiety medication)
- Benzodiazepines (rarely recommended due to dependence risk)

**Important notes:**

- Only prescribed by MD/psychiatrist
- Most effective combined with therapy
- Not performance-enhancing drugs (just reduce symptoms)
- Different medications work for different people
- Takes trial and error to find right fit

## Creating Your Pre-Audition Anxiety Management Ritual

Rituals create sense of control and predictability, reducing anxiety.

### Sample Pre-Audition Routine (Night Before)

**8:00 PM: Wind down begins**

- Review sides one final time (no new changes)
- Visualization practice (5 minutes)
- Lay out wardrobe and materials
- Pack audition bag

**9:00 PM: Relaxation routine**

- Gentle stretching or yoga (15 minutes)
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Journal about any worries (get them out)
- Read for pleasure or watch calming show

**10:00 PM: Sleep prep**

- Turn off screens
- Cool, dark room
- Mindfulness meditation or body scan
- Deep breathing until sleep comes

### Sample Pre-Audition Routine (Day Of)

**2-3 hours before:**

- Light meal (nothing heavy)
- Physical warm-up (15 minutes)
- Vocal warm-up if needed
- Review character choices (not obsessively)

**1 hour before:**

- Leave home with extra time
- Listen to pre-audition playlist
- Box breathing exercises
- Positive affirmations

**30 minutes before (in waiting room):**

- Grounding exercises
- Physical centering
- Review sides once quietly
- Stay off phone/email
- Hydrate
- Use bathroom

**5 minutes before:**

- Final breath work
- Positive visualization
- Remind yourself: "I'm prepared. I'm here to share my work. Whatever happens is okay."
- Enter space with confidence

### Your Playlist for Calm

Create a playlist that centers you:

- Songs that make you feel strong
- Music without lyrics (less distracting)
- Calming instrumental pieces
- Nature sounds or binaural beats
- Nothing emotionally charged
- 30-45 minutes total

## The Audition Itself: In-the-Moment Management

Despite all preparation, anxiety may arise during the audition. Here's how to manage it:

### If You Feel Anxiety Rising

**Don't:**

- Apologize for being nervous
- Draw attention to anxiety symptoms
- Try to force yourself to relax
- Fight the feelings
- Spiral into catastrophic thinking

**Do:**

- Acknowledge anxiety silently ("I notice anxiety")
- Take one slow, deep breath
- Ground feet firmly on floor
- Focus on your objective (what character wants)
- Channel energy into performance
- Trust your preparation
- Stay in the moment

### If You Blank on Lines

**In the moment:**

- Don't apologize or break character
- Pause, breathe, find your place
- If really stuck: "May I start again?"
- Most CDs won't even notice small stumbles
- Keep going if you remember

**Preventing blanking:**

- Know your lines well (but not robot-perfect)
- Understand thought behind each line
- Can paraphrase if you blank
- Focus on listening, not reciting

### Channeling Nervous Energy

Adrenaline can add energy and intensity if you channel it into character's emotions and actions:

**Techniques:**

- Interpret nervous energy as character's energy
- Use it for high-stakes scenes
- Let trembling voice be character's vulnerability
- Transform anxiety into excitement
- Ride the energy rather than resist it

### Post-Audition Processing

**After you leave:**

- Note what you learned
- Acknowledge you did the work
- Let go of outcome
- Reward yourself (coffee, walk, something enjoyable)
- Don't obsess over mistakes
- Focus on next opportunity
- Journal if helpful

## Building Long-Term Audition Confidence

Confidence comes from consistent practice and evidence of capability.

### Audition Practice Regimen

**Weekly practice:**

- Cold read new sides (build comfort with material)
- Record self-tapes (desensitize to camera)
- Practice in front of friends (build comfort with observers)
- Attend low-stakes auditions (student films, workshops)

**Monthly challenges:**

- Take on material outside comfort zone
- Audition for things with low booking chance (practice)
- Perform monologues for class
- Do open mics or showcases

### Documenting Progress

Keep an audition journal tracking:

- Date and project
- Anxiety level before (0-10)
- Techniques used
- How you felt during
- What went well
- What to work on
- Feedback received
- Anxiety level after (0-10)

**Benefits:**

- Proves you're improving
- Identifies what techniques work for you
- Patterns become visible
- Evidence counters negative thoughts
- Builds confidence through data

### Celebrating Non-Booking Wins

Success isn't just booking:

- Showed up despite anxiety
- Made strong choices
- Took direction well
- Connected with material
- Stayed present
- Learned something
- Met new industry people
- Got practice
- Felt proud of your work

Each of these is a victory worth celebrating.

## Special Considerations

### Virtual Auditions and Technology Anxiety

**Additional anxiety sources:**

- Technical failures (connection, sound)
- Unfamiliar with platform
- Awkward virtual communication
- Can't read room energy
- Distracted by seeing yourself on screen

**Management strategies:**

- Test technology well in advance
- Have tech support plan (backup device, hotspot)
- Practice on Zoom with friends
- Minimize self-view during audition
- Focus on connection despite format
- Remember CDs are experienced with virtual awkwardness

### Audition Anxiety for Neurodivergent Actors

ADHD, autism, and other neurodivergent conditions can affect anxiety:

**Additional challenges:**

- Sensory overwhelm in waiting rooms
- Executive function difficulties with preparation
- Social communication differences
- Difficulty reading social cues
- Time management struggles
- Emotional regulation differences

**Strategies:**

- Arrive very early to decompress
- Use noise-canceling headphones
- Request accommodations if needed
- Break preparation into smaller steps
- Use timers and reminders
- Work with therapist familiar with neurodivergence
- Leverage unique strengths and perspectives

### Cultural and Identity Factors

Performance anxiety can intersect with:

- Impostor syndrome (especially for underrepresented actors)
- Stereotype anxiety
- Code-switching demands
- Industry bias and discrimination
- Pressure to represent entire community

**Additional support:**

- Connect with communities of shared identity
- Work with culturally competent therapist
- Find mentors who understand your experience
- Remember your perspective is valuable and needed
- Set boundaries around what you're willing to tolerate

## The Bottom Line on Audition Anxiety

Audition anxiety is normal, common, and manageable. The goal isn't to eliminate it completely—that's unrealistic and unnecessary. The goal is to perform effectively despite anxiety.

**Core principles:**

1. Accept that anxiety will be present
2. Don't let anxiety stop you from auditioning
3. Practice techniques consistently (not just before auditions)
4. Build resilience through exposure
5. Reframe meaning of auditions
6. Seek professional help if needed
7. Celebrate courage it takes to keep going

**Remember:**

- Even successful actors experience anxiety
- You can deliver strong auditions while anxious
- Each audition is practice
- Skills improve with consistency
- You're not alone in this struggle
- Help is available
- Your anxiety doesn't define your worth or talent

The actors who build lasting careers aren't those who never feel nervous—they're the ones who feel nervous and show up anyway, building systems to manage anxiety while honoring their commitment to their craft.
