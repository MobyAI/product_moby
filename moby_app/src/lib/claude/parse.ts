Parse the script into JSON. Each object must include:
- "type": "scene", "line", or "direction"
- "index": original order in script
- For "line": include "character", "gender", inferred "tone", and "lineEndKeywords"
- Focus on inferring tone accurately from context; two word description is okay

Guidelines:
- "lineEndKeywords" should contain 1-2 reliable, high-signal words from the final sentence of the line
- These words do not need to be the last 2 words in the sentence
- Choose words that reflect the meaning or emotional intent of the final thought
- Pick words that are unlikely to be skipped or altered, even if the actor paraphrases
- Avoid names, rare words, or anything that speech-to-text systems often mishear
- Do not choose words that also occur earlier in the line! Must be unique

Do not rewrite anything. Do not add commentary.

YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE:
- Pure JSON only
- No markdown code blocks
- No explanatory text
- Start with [ and end with ]
- Ready to parse with JSON.parse()

Example format:
[
  { "index": 0, "type": "scene", "text": "INT. KITCHEN â€“ DAY" },
  { "index": 1, "type": "line", "character": "JANE", "gender", "text": "What are you doing here?", "tone": "suspicious", "lineEndKeywords": "doing", "here" },
  { "index": 2, "type": "direction", "text": "He steps back cautiously." }
]

Script:
"""${scriptText}"""
