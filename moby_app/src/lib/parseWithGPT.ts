Parse the script into JSON. Each object must include:
- "type": "scene", "line", or "direction"
- "index": original order in script
- For "line": include "character" and inferred "tone"
- Focus on inferring tone accurately from context; two word description is okay
Do not rewrite anything.

YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE:
- Pure JSON only
- No markdown code blocks
- No explanatory text
- Start with [ and end with ]
- Ready to parse with JSON.parse()

Example format:
[
  { "index": 0, "type": "scene", "text": "INT. KITCHEN â€“ DAY" },
  { "index": 1, "type": "line", "character": "JANE", "text": "What are you doing here?", "tone": "suspicious" },
  { "index": 2, "type": "direction", "text": "He steps back cautiously." }
]

Script:
"""${scriptText}"""
